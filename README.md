# Persistent-Gags-and-Mutes

### The gagging portion of this addon does not work at the moment.

An addon for Garry's Mod expanding the capabilities of the mute and gag commands in ULX admin mod.

This addon adds two new commands: ulx tgag and ulx tmute. These commands not only allow an admin to mute or gag a player for a specified number of minutes, but this mute or gag will persist between player sessions, a feature that is not present in the default ULX mute and gag commands.

This addon is installed in the addon folder. It requires ULib and ULX admin mod, which can be found at https://ulyssesmod.net/downloads.php

You must grant the ulx tgag, ulx tmute, ulx untgag and ulx untmute permissions to your staff groups.

# Persistent-Gags-and-Mutes

An addon for Garry's Mod expanding the capabilities of the mute and gag commands in ULX admin mod.

These commands are adapted from the votemute, votegag and pgag commands in cobalt77's "Custom-ULX-Commands" package (https://github.com/cobalt77/Custom-ULX-Commands). You should totally be using this command package if you aren't already!

This addon adds four new commands: ulx tgag, ulx printtgags, ulx tmute and ulx printtmutes. These commands not only allow an admin to mute or gag a player for a specified number of minutes, but this mute or gag will persist between player sessions, a feature that is not present in the default ULX mute and gag commands.

This addon is installed in the addon folder. It requires ULib and ULX admin mod, which can be found at https://ulyssesmod.net/downloads.php
